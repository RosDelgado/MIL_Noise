# "A Simple Approach to Multiple Instance Learning: Controlling the False Positive Rate"
## by Rosario Delgado (submitted to publication)

Requirements: To create the graphs in Simulations.R, the library ggplot is needed
Simulations.R uses the algorithms implemented in Algorithms.R

This repository was developed by Rosario Delgado (Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona, 2024) with the valuable collaboration of Xavier-Andoni Tibau, who contributed to the implementation of the application of the CausalMIL algorithm to obtain the instance-level predictions for the Colon Cancer dataset (Section 4.3).
