R Scripts for the experimentation phase of the manuscript: 

"A Simple Approach to Multiple Instance Learning with Noisy Instance Labels"

Requirements: To create the graphs in Simulations.R, the library ggplot is needed
Simulations.R uses the algorithms implemented in Algorithms.R

Author: Rosario Delgado, Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona

Algorithms: contains implementations of Algorithms 1 and 2 of the paper.

mat_square: converts to square any confusion matrix by adding zero rows or columns.

Simulations: simulation experiments for the Section 4.1 of the paper.

Real_Dataset_Musk2: experimental work with the Musk-2 dataset for Section 4.2. 
                    Uses library tidyverse and milr, in addition to ggplot.
